        <h3>Whiteboard</h3>
        Get bored of writing revision notes and wanna try something new? Rather than making a shedload of notes you won't ever read, get a whiteboard.
        Hang whiteboard in visible place, and make notes from difficult topics when revising.
        Draw diagrams to refresh memory and before you know it, it'll be crammed with notes from a whole unit.
        Make sure you can easily refer to it and is often in your life of sight.As soon as you feel you have understood the unit, wipe and repeat.
