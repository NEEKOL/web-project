          Although following all our revision tips is a great first step to success, we also want you to look after yourself.
          <br />
          During times of high stress such as these, it is quite common for students to find greater difficulties in coping. It can even get so bad for some that their mental health begins to suffer. Don't forget that looking after yourself includes mentally, as well as physically!
          <br />
          <br />
          Have you found yourself:
          <ul class="brain_bulletpoint">
            <li><span>Finding it increasingly difficult to sleep at night?</span></li>
            <li><span>Losing your appetite?</span></li>
            <li><span>Losing interest in things you used to enjoy?<span></li>
            <li><span>Constantly worrying about problems out of your control?</span></li>
            <li><span>Finding difficulties in remaining focused on your work due to intrusive thoughts?</span></li>
            <li><span>Feeling anxious or more agitated than usual?</span></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="first_paragraph">
          If you answered yes to any of the above, you may need some extra support. Don't be afraid to seek help - you're certainly not the first one to have experienced this!
          Below are some recommended sources of support.
